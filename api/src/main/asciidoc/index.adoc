= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs
This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

.links
include::{snippets}/home/links.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/home/http-request.adoc[]

.response fields
include::{snippets}/home/response-fields.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/home/http-response.adoc[]




As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.

== and we have a search
you can perform a fulltext search
.request
include::{snippets}/search/curl-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/search/http-response.adoc[]
